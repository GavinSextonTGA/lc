## The Process
I was inspired to use the rhythm from a producer I look up to, Sunnexo, the bass drum rhythm is taken from their song ["Internet Exploder"](https://sunnexo.moe/internet-exploder). Due to this process of recreation I had to lay things out in groups of 4 when working on it to not lose sight of the actual beat. The bd rhythm went fairly smoothly tho it was quite barren being an unchanging bass drum, I decided in order to add some energy I'd add a snare drum to beats 2 and 4 of each measure, this helped but was a little underwhelming still as it utilized nothing unique from tinytidal and was just acting as a knockoff drum machine. The arrays seemed like a nice thing to include as they didn't mess up my established rhythm and added some needed variation, so I replaced every snare hit to randomly select a snare, clap, hat or tom and that made me more satisfied with it. Nothing crazy but a fun tool to mess around with especially with the randomization.
